you might think it sucks here
but its really nice and quiet
i used to be scared of the dark
but then i reallised that...
the dark is only scary if you make it scary
there are no monsters if you don't imagine their exsistance
remeber that the next time you go into a scary room
the scariest thing there is your imagination
not the room
